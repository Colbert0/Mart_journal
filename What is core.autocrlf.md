"used to change how Git handles line endings" What are line ending? I think it's a character that you put along in the file or text file which tells the computer when to show the text on the screen on the next line. Excluding the line ending character. Because if that was just written without a line ending, then I think the computer would  just print out the entire text in a single line and you'd have to scroll horizontally to read all of it.

Why does git need to be bothered by this? Because I think different types of computer software have different line endings and so if git were to just put a file in the repository with the line ending formatting of one platform and then another machine on a different platform copies that file into their machine, there could be errors in how the computer shows the file in the screen.

Why do these different platforms have different line ending formats? I don't know, but for this mini essay I think it's enough to know that files need these characters to tell the computer when to go to the next line and that different computer platforms use different line ending formats. So there could be a conflict when different platforms use a single repository on github. I still don't know deeply how these things work so I gotta learn more about it.
